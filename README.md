# DOUBLE_ADVENTURE_GAME_IN_C++

This is a combined C++ project where the Circle Rush arcade game and the Rock–Paper–Scissors Challenge game are merged into a single menu-driven system, allowing players to enjoy a complete gaming experience with profile selection, score tracking, and history saving features.


## 📄Description:

Circle Rush Game & RPS Challenge Game

This is a C++ console project combining two exciting games in one: Circle Rush and Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) Challenge. Circle Rush Game: Catch falling balls with your player, earn points, and avoid misses. RPS Challenge Game: Play Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer with win/loss tracking. Supports multiple player profiles, each with its own high score and game history. Game progress and scores are saved in text files for persistent tracking. Includes pause and resume functionality for both games. Features an interactive menu system to select games and manage profiles. Designed to teach C++ programming, including classes, file I/O, and console-based graphics. Fun and simple for beginners while demonstrating good programming structure and modularity.

## 💡 Key Concepts Used:

(i) C++ Classes & Objects – Organized Circle Rush and RPS game logic.

(ii) File I/O – Save/load player profiles, high scores, and game history.

(iii) Vectors & STL – Store dynamic lists of players, balls, and histories.

(iv) Random Number Generation – For ball positions and computer choices in RPS.

(v) Console Graphics – Simple visual display using ASCII characters.

(vi) Input Handling – Keyboard inputs for movement, game controls, and menus.

(vii) Conditional Logic & Loops – Game rules, score tracking, and replay logic.

(viii) Function Modularization – Separate functions for menu, game run, and profile management.

(ix) Sound Feedback – Beep tones for game actions in Circle Rush.

(x) Pause/Resume & Quit Options – Improve gameplay experience and control flow.

## ✨ Features:

* Play Circle Rush Game and RPS Challenge Game in a single project.

* Multiple Player Profiles with individual high scores and histories.

* Score Tracking and persistent game history saved in text files.

* Interactive Menu System to choose games and manage profiles easily.

* Catch Falling Balls in Circle Rush to earn points.

* Challenge the computer in Rock-Paper-Scissors with win/loss stats.

* Pause/Resume & Quit Options for both games.

* Simple Console Graphics with ASCII representation of games.

* Sound Feedback in Circle Rush for catching/missing balls.

* Modular and Organized Code using classes, functions, and file I/O.

## 🔔 Purpose:

To create an engaging console-based gaming experience in C++. To practice object-oriented programming concepts like classes and objects. To implement file handling for saving player profiles, scores, and history. To develop interactive menus and game control mechanisms like pause/resume. To learn game logic implementation, including score tracking and win/loss determination.  To combine two different games in a single modular project for learning and fun.

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced:

-> C++ Classes & Objects – Organizing game logic and player data.

-> File I/O – Reading and writing player profiles, scores, and histories.

-> Vectors & STL – Dynamic storage of balls, players, and histories.

-> Random Number Generation – For ball positions and computer choices in RPS.

-> Loops & Conditional Statements – Core game mechanics and decision-making.

-> Functions & Modular Programming – Separating tasks for clarity and reusability.

-> Keyboard Input Handling – Moving player, menu selection, and pause/resume control.

-> Console Graphics with ASCII – Displaying game elements visually.

-> Sound Feedback – Using Beep for interactive feedback in Circle Rush.

-> Game State Management – Tracking score, missed balls, wins/losses, and high scores.

## ▶️ How to Run:

1. Install a C++ compiler (GCC, MinGW, Visual Studio, etc.).

2. Download or clone the repository.

3. Open terminal/command prompt in the project folder.

4. Main Menu will appear with options:

* Circle Rush Game

* RPS Challenge Game

5. Select your game choice.

6. Choose or create a player profile.

7. Follow on-screen instructions for gameplay.

8. Use keyboard controls to move, pause, or quit.

9. Scores and history are saved automatically.

10. Replay or switch games from the Main Menu.

11. Exit anytime via the menu or quit option.
